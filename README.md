ontology
========

This repository contains the DataCite Metadata Kernel v2.2 to RDF Mapping Document (DataCite2RDF) and related documents.  

The DataCite Ontology itself, an OWL 2 DL ontology created specifically to provide classes and object properties required to 
express DataCite metadata in RDF, but missing from other ontologies, was created as one of the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and 
Referencing) ontologies, and is maintained in the SPAR SourceForge Subversion Repository, and is available from 
http://purl.org/spar/datacite/.  We employs content negotiation to deliver human-readable ontology documentation using LODE,
the Live OWL DOcumentation Environment, when a user accesses the DataCite Ontology through a browser, or the .owl ontology 
itelf when the user requests the ontology from an ontology browser.  

The current version of the DataCite Ontology is v0.6, dated 13 July 2012.
